---- INITIAL SETUP ----
1) ssh into server box
	- use command "ssh <user>@<domain>"
	- "ubuntu@ateam.iw-c.co.uk" in our case
2) copy required files to server box
	- can be done using an FTP client, or by cloning GitHub repo
3) install any dependencies (python modules quik, click, prettyTable, and flask in this case)
4) navigate to directory where the python file with the entry point to the program is
5) use the "screen" command to open a new screen
6) start up Flask
	- use command "FLASK_APP=table_tennis.py FLASK_DEBUG=1 python -m flask run&"
	- the "&" will run the task in the background
7) detach from the current screen by using Ctrl + A, and then pressing the "d" key
8) the ssh connection to the server can be closed without affecting the running of the site


---- FURTHER INFO ----
1) to re-attach to the screen session:
	- ssh into server box (same command as before)
	- use command "screen -r" to reattach to the session
	- interface will display a list of screen sessions with further instructions if more than one screen session has been initialised
